- How do frameworks actually work? They are usually a set of stylesheets that establish style rules for different elements or groups of elements on the site.
- How do you interact with the framework to get the look you want? you simpley rewrite the default code
- What is Twitter Bootstrap?  it is a continually evolving style guide that that was created as a framework for Twitter applications but is now used by many other websites, including Sendgrid and Codeacademy
- What other frameworks can you find out there? Golen Grid, titan, 960 Grid, skeleton, tuktuk, kube, gumby
- What are the disadvantages of using frameworks?  If the framework is hosted in one place then it can end up requiring lots
