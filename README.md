# Introduction to Bootstrap for frontend and CSS

##### Questions to answer:
- What are CSS frameworks?
  - css frameworks are a collection of css files kinda like a library that gives you a bunch of existing classes that allow for expedient, more standard-compliant styling of a web page and relieves you of (most of) the headache of getting all your styles to play nice together
- How do frameworks actually work?
  - they're collections of css files that are interacted with in a specific policy dependent on what framework you're using
- How do you interact with the framework to get the look you want?
  - in the context of bootstrap, you break up what you want your web page to look like into rows and columns, and as far as my workflow goes, mess with it until it works
- What is Twitter Bootstrap?
  - it's a grid-based CSS framework developed by twitter, originally internal to twitter itself for making management interfaces i believe
- What other frameworks can you find out there?
  - cascade, concise, ink, unsemantic
- What are the disadvantages of using frameworks?
  - they can often result in samey, generic websites, especially in the hands of people not super familiar with the framework and all its customization options
