   They work as a package, which are made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code such as HTML or CSS, which can be used to support the development of websites.  

- How do you interact with the framework to get the look you want?  
    To interact with the framework to make it look how we want it to, you modify the files, then you over ride them, which you put after the bootstrap. So you are override the the code in your own custom file then put them to bootstrap.
